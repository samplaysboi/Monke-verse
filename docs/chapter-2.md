# Chapter 2 - _On the run_

The group walks out the temple and sails to an island to hide.

As they got to the island, they plan what to do next, but as they start planning a bullet flies through the air and hits a tree. The group investigates it. Then Markus gets suddently pulled away. And a fake Markus comes out and says:

"Hey guys look at what I found!", said the fake Markus. 

The group comes to the fake Markus and sees a gun.

"I found this gun", said the fake Markus.

"Why is there a gun here?", asked Aaron.

Then out of nowhere a giant fleet of ships approaches the island.

"Guys they dont look friendly", said Simon.

"Wait, is that Yeet?", asked Daniel.

"Yea it is", Lias anwsered.

"Hey guys", said Yeet. 

The group looks at the fleet of ships.

"Guys we gotta get out of here", said Aaron.

As the ships arrive on the island, Yeet jumps of one of the ships with his katana and starts dashing at the group. Yeet slashes the air and sends out multiple cursed projectiles at the group. Aaron gets hit by 3 projectiles and starts bleeding out. The group quickly rushes to Aaron and heals him up. Yeet dashes at them again and criticaly impales Daniel through the heart. The group tries to heal Daniel but Yeet stops them and kicks all them back with a wave of curse magic. Then, suddently, the fake Markus stabs Daniel in the leg with a sword. Then the fake Markus turns into a man, and he introduces himself as Cyrill number 2 of the 10 flames.

"Thanks for helping me out Yeet", said Cyrill.

"No problem", said Yeet.

Cyrill then shows the real Markus who is trapped. Then they both leave.
