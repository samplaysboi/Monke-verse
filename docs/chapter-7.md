## Chapter 7 - _To Dominius!_

12 years ago.

It was 10 in the morning as a 8 year old runs back home from the local supermarket.

She was late for her moms birthday, because she was distracted from the carnival.

She loved the carnival she would go there any time she had.

As she got home she felt that something was off.

She didnt think anything about it and opened the door.

"Mom! Dad! Im home!" she said. But there was no response.

She then went into the kitchen to try to find out where her parents are.

As she came into the kitchen she saw the bodies of her parents. As she froze as she saw the bodies, She quickly looked up and saw Dominius with his dark armor.

Fear quickly rush through her entire body as Dominius lunges at her.

Scared she ran as fast as she can away from him. 

A wall suddently appears from the ground as she saw Metronome on top of a building.

Signus then shows up from a roof of a building and seting the whole village on fire.

As Dominius was gonna land the finishing blow on the girl, a flash of purple fire speeds past them as Avernus blocks Dominiuses hand. 

Dominius then attacks Avernus but he effortlesly blocks it and send out a wave of gamma flames.

Signus sees the flames and becomes amazed with the fire.

As he is mezmorised from the fire Avernus sends a wave of fire at him.

Avernus grabs the girl and flies away. A few minutes later they reached an island where they can hide.

"hey are you okay?" Avernus asked but the girl didnt anwser.

"hey is there any way i could help you?" asked Avernus. But no anwser came.

"hey is there anyone you know that we could go to to find some help?" asked Avernus yet again.

"n-no" said the girl with a sad tone.

A few akward minutes later the little girl asked: "w-whats your name?" "my name? oh its Avernus but you can call me Sam, whats your name?" said Avernus. "Alice thats my name." said Alice.

"Alice huh thats a nice name."

The group sees as Avernus takes a few steps towards them.

"guys?" asked Avernus.

I thought i died. 

"well yea but we brought you back to life." said Trevor.

"Trevor! Alright do you guys have the book?" asked Avernus.

"uhhhhhhhhhhhh so about that." said Markus.

"also guys wheres Aaron?" asked Avernus.

"soooo Aarons dead and a guy named Dominius has the book." said Daniel.

"what. We are getting that back. I need that book." said Avernus.

"yea so he kinda needs that book to defeat the virus god." Trevor informed.

As the group left the temple Avernus took them to a forest.

"ill take you to someone that we need for the fight with Dominius." said Avernus.

As they where walking through the forest they hear talking in the distance.

In the distance they see a army of virus soldiers.

The soldiers brought out there guns and then started shooting.

As the bullets flew towards them Avernus takes out a katana and effortlesly blocked all the bullets.

As the soldiers got closer Avernus creates arms with his shadow powers and sends a wave of black fire with a neon red outline, killing most of the soldiers.

"we should go" said Avernus.

Suddenly a familiar face appeared.

"yeet?" said Avernus.

Yeet then dashed at Avernus.

Avernus then set his sword on fire and clashed with Yeet.

The soldiers then shoot at Avernus.

suddenly Avernuses powers was weakened, because of the special bullets the soldiers had.

William then attacks yeet but he blocks it.

Avernus then uses his arms to pick up the group and fly away.

As they were flying Avernus got shot a few times.

Avernus shortly fell down later.

There only option now was to fight.

As the soldiers got closer the group rush at the soldiers and Yeet.

Avernus and Yeet then fought while the other fight off the soldiers.

Avernus summons arms and combines them and slams Yeet into the ground.

Avernus then grabs and crushes most of the soldiers.

Avernus then grabs the group and fly away again.

As they made it out of the forest a figure with a robe awaits them.

"ah Avernus your back!" says the man.

"whos that?" asked William.

"Thats Viridian the virus god." said Avernus.

Viridian then sends a virus tentacle at the group, but Avernus blocks it.

Viridian then takes out his sword and sends a giant slash at the group.

Avernus tries to block it but he fails and is heavily injured.

The group then try to help Avernus but Viridian hits them all back heavily injuring them as well.

Avernus stands up with fire flowing through his body.

Avernus then sends a Gamma punch towards Viridian, it hits him but it doesnt do much damage.

"guys! you need get out of here now you will die if you try to fight him. Trevor take him to where Alice is!" Avernus screamed.

Avernus then barrages Viridian with his gamma fists.

Viridian then hits Avernus in the heart with many virus tentacles.

Avernus grabs his sword.

Viridian then suddenly floats in the air.

Avernus jumps up in the air and slices Viridian in the chest, heavily injuring him and slicing a through dimensions.

The group watched in shock.

The group then use the time to run away.

Viridian sees this and sends a special virus tentacle, at Trevor.

As Trevor is about to get hit William pushes Trevor away and William is hit in the eye instead of Trevor.

William falls to the groud in pain.

Avernus tries to help but is slashed away knocked away with a deadly slash.

William looks up at Viridian.

"ah it worked." Viridian said.

Suddenly William's eye then regenerated quickly.

And from the new eye comes a eye with a red cog wheel inside.

"William! your eye!" said Lias.

"my virus worked." Viridian said.

"what did you do?" Daniel asked. 

"i infected him with my virus element.

I can now see through his eye and find out wherever you are at any moment.

But he has a new virus eye that gives him a few abilitys" Viridian anwsered.

"guys get out of here now! Ill catch up later." Avernus yelled.

As the group started to escape the battle, Viridian tried to stop them but Avernus stoped Viridian.

Viridian pulls out a sword and dashes at Avernus and slashses through him.

The shlash doesn't do much but a second later he gets slahsed over 100 times.

Avernus fell to the ground, and as Viridian got closer, Avernus punches Viridian with the fists that he summoned on his back.

Avernus jumps in the air, then he combines 75 arms and uses an attack called Ravenger to slam Viridian in the ground.

Avernus also lights his hand on fire with his gamma flames.

Viridian gets knocked into the ground.

Avernus then takes the chance to run and charges his arms and legs with gamma flames and flies away.

Viridian sees Avernus and sends a virus tentacle at Avernus.

The tentacle latches on to his leg and starts dragging him to the ground.

Avernus then creates 50 arms and makes all the arms shoot gamma flames and flies faster than before, and burns the tentacle, letting Avernus escape.

a few seconds later Avernus meets up with the rest of the group.

The group then go there safe house.

A few hours later they make it to the safe house.

"A-Avernus? your back!" said a young girl.

"hey whats up Alice. Could you heal Trevor and my friends here" said Avernus.

"sure thing" said Alice.

"who's this?" Simon asked.

"oh my friend. She actually hates Dominius as well by the way so we have more of a reason to kill him." Avernus explained.

"you also want to kill Dominius?" Alice asked.

"yea he killed one of our friends and he stole something important."

Daniel explained.

After a few hours the group were fully healed.

The group the start training for the fight with Dominius.

Avernus teaches the group how to master their elements.

William then tries to use his virus eye.

He notices that his perception is slightly slower thus making it so that he can dodge attacks.

He also notices that he can turn that ability on and off.

He also gained a ability which makes it so he can see information about the thing that he is looking at.

His reaction time is also now increased.

A few weeks of training later the group felt ready but they just didn't know how to get to Dominiuses castle.

As they where talking a phoenix suddenly flys in the dirrection of the group.

"woah whats that?" the group asked.

"thats my pet phoenix that my dad gave me when i was young". Avernus said.

"can it talk and whats its name?" asked Simon.

"yea i can talk. Also my name is Yatagarasu" said the bird.

The phoenix was covered in the black fire that Avernus could shoot out while they where in the forest.

"Yatagarasu here is gonna help us fight Dominius." Avernus explained.

The group then try to figure out how to get to Dominiuses castle.

The group couldn't think of any idea of how to get to the castle.

The group then thought about mabye contacting Dominius.

But Avernus had an idea. 

He grabs his katana jumps in the air and slashes the air creating a rift in time. 

The group then see the different dimensions from the slash that Avernus made. 

"we can go to different dimensions but i need a lot of energy to be able to use this attack." Avernus said.

"so you guys wanna go fight him now?" Avernus asked.

"yea we need to get that book now." Said Daniel.

The group get ready and jump in the rift.

They then jump into the rift.

A few seconds later a rift suddenly appears in the throne room of Dominiuses castle.

Aperture walks to the rift.

"guys whats this?" said Aperture.

as Aperture goes to check out the rift, Avernus appears through the rift and kicks Aperture in the chest.

The rest of the group then jumps out from the rift.

Dominius then says: "Avernus! We meet again how are yo-" Avernus then punches Dominius sending him to the wall.

"not the type to talk huh? Well i wasn't gonna talk much anyway. You know we would lose this battle. But with this book i can finally beat you!" Dominius screamed.

Tubes then rise up from the ground.

The tubes then extract the power from the Book of the Monke and Demonke.

Dominius, Aperture, Chronos, Null and  Metronome then get a upgrade in power making them much more powerful.

Dominius then charges up his hands with dark matter energy and get ready to fight.

"ready to battle Avernus?" Said Dominius.

"yea." said Avernus calmy.

The group then gets ready to battle.

Avernus chrages up a hand with fire and starts the battle.
