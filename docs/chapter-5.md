## Chapter 5 - _The Elements & The Crystal_

The group look towards the sound and they see a man wearing a black robe.,,hello? who are you?´´ asked Simon.

,,i am Trevor, i am one of the fortunate poeple to survive the great calamity.´´ Said Trevor.

,,whats the great Calamity?´´ Markus asked.

,,The great calamity was a war against the shadow god Soru and the god of this element called Virus.
Its an element that can cancel anything for example your attacks. In the war the shadow god ended up dying.
but luckily Soru had a kid that at the time was 10.
As the child got older the virus god went to war against him and he also got deafeated, and he also had a child and so on and so forth.´´ Trevor anwsered.

,,Oh and if you dont mind where did you guys come from?´´ asked Trevor.

,,Dominius we came from Dominiuses castle´´ said the group.

,,Dominius? you came back from fighting them? you guys are lucky your even alive.´´ Trevor said.

suddently the group hears yelling in the distance. Trevor than says: ,,oh no guys we have to go now! No time to explain´´.

Trevor then signals the group to follow him, the group then follow him to a boat, then they sail to Trevors home base.

As they got to Trevors base Trevor explained: ,,The reason why im getting chased its beacause i survived the great calamity.´´.

Trevor then shows the group around his base. Trevor then signals all of the gorup to follow him again.

trevor then showed the group a cave with markings all over the walls ,,these markings are from something called the eclipse war.

The eclipse war was a battle between the two first gods the solar god and the lunar god.

They were brother that both had different goals in life. The solar god chose to restore peace among the people, 
but the lunar god chose destruction.

The lunar god didnt see anything usefull in this land,
so in an act to protect this land the solar god chose to go to war against his brother.

The solar god knew he could not win the war all by himself so he created Soru the god of shadow and Aether the god of light.

In the end the solar god ended up wining the war but he was later killed by the devourer of gods one of the strongest subordinates.

As the solar god died he asked for Soru and Aether to one day defeat the devourer of gods,
the solar god also then created all of the other elements other than solar, lunar, shadow and light.

but Soru and Aether where gravely injured so Soru and Aether tried to teach othesr people the elements.

But One of the people he taught was the Virus god.´´

The group the asked: ,,how did Soru and Aether survive the war against the lunar god?´´.

Trevor than anwsered: ,,Oh its beacause of demon blood.´´ ,,Demon blood?´´. the group asked

,,yea demon blood it makes it so when you drink it makes it so you cant die from aging,
and you cant die except when someone cuts your neck off or when someone does enough damage to you, you stop regenerating.´´Trevor said.

As the group kept going through the cave they saw a familiar face. ,, wait is that sam?´´ asked Markus.

,,hmmm? who? oh thats avernus.´´ awnsered Trevor.

,,sam has a secret name and is a one of the shadow gods We need to revive him somehow´´ said Simon.

,,wait hes dead? how?´´ asked Trevor.

by some guy named Atom.´´ Daniel and Zach anwsered. ,,so now what do we do?´´ asked Trevor.

,,is there anyway to revive someone?´´ Simon asked.

,,theres one way´´ Trevor anwsered.

Daniel then asks: ,,how?´´

,,there a dungeon filled with traps various monsters and guards its dangerous but when you get to the end it gives you a crystal of resurection that can be used in a shrine to revive anyone.
But it only revives one person one month before their death after a month of their death that person cannot be revived anymore.´´Trevor anwsered.

,,sams death was 3 weeks and 3 days ago. said Zach

,,3 weeks! to get to the dungeon already takes 2 days and and to get to the shrine takes another 2 days.´´Treavor said.

the group then says: ,,well we better get going then´´
