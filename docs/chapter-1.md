They wanted to know the history about how The Monke God made the Universe. They approached the secret Base of the President of Mineke. They had to do it quietly or else they will be executed. 

Aaron said: "Guys I have a bad feeling about this.“

"Stop being a Wimp, Aaron!,“ gulped Sam

"Sams right. We are pros ist sneaking in hidden bases“ said Daniel and Markus confidently.

As the group of friends entered the building, they got a weird feeling.
But they ignored it.

"Zach, look over there. It’s a big red door. Wanna check it out?“ said Sam.

"Im not sure, bro. I already got an eerie feeling about this.“ said Zach back.

Still, Zach follow Sam reluctantly to the red door.

"We are gonna check out the door real quick. We will be back in a sec.“ said Zach und Sam in Union.

As Zach and Sam checked out the unopened room, The others were looking for the book.
Suddenly out of nowhere a strange eerie sound was to be heard when Zach and Sam opened a door. The boys were trembling with fear. Out of nowhere a giant fog came into the room which was toxic. This fog could easily melt your skin and bone off. The boys immediately freaked out and ran separate ways. Zach went with Daniel and Yeet, Sam went with Aaron and Markus, and Lias went with Simon.

while they where running a trapdoor suddently oppens in the group witth Zach, Daniel and Yeet. Yeet falls down into the trapdoor, and heres a erie voice "did you find them?"

"I dont know he just kinda disappeared" Zach anwsered.

"stay still both of you" said the man.

"WHO ARE YOU?" yelled Zach. 

"not the best tone to say to someone when your trying to be spared" said the man 

"i am-" then Daniel punches the man in the face and grabs zach.

Daniel and Zach run away and yell "HELP!". 

Sam hears Daniels voice and rushes to him as he saw Daniel Sam said "Hey! i found you!"

As he said that the axe of the man flies through the air piercing Sam and killing him.
Sams lifeless body lays there while the man comes out of the shadow introducing himself as Atom the bounty hunter.
