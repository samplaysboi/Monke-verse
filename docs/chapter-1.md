# Chapter 1 - _A new era_

Aaron and his friends were exploring around the city of Mineke. They were looking for an enchanted book called The Legendary War of Monke and Demonke. They wanted to know the history about how The Monke God made the Universe. They approached the secret Base of the President of Mineke. They had to do it quietly or else they will be executed. 

Aaron said: "Guys, I have a bad feeling about this".

"Stop being a wimp, Aaron!", gulped Sam.

"Sam is right. We are pros in sneaking in hidden bases", said Daniel and Markus confidently.

As the group of friends entered the building, they got a weird feeling.
But they ignored it.

"Zach, look over there". It’s a big red door. "Wanna check it out?", said Sam.

"Im not sure, bro. I already got an eerie feeling about this", said Zach back.

Still, Zach followed Sam reluctantly to the red door.

"We are gonna check out the door quickly. We will be back in a sec", said Zach und Sam in Union.

As Zach and Sam checked out the unopened room while the others were looking for the book.
Suddenly, out of nowhere, a strange eerie sound was to be heard when Zach and Sam opened a door. The boys were trembling with fear. Out of nowhere, a giant fog came into the room which was toxic. This fog could easily melt your skin and bone off. The boys immediately freaked out and spilt into groups. Zach went with Daniel and Yeet, Sam went with Aaron and Markus, and Lias went with Simon.

While they were running, a trapdoor suddently opened in the group with Zach, Daniel and Yeet. Yeet fell down into the trapdoor, and heard an erie voice "did you find them?".

(then it switches to Daniel and Zach) "where's Yeet?" asked Daniel.

"I don´t know he just kinda disappeared" Zach anwsered.

Then suddently, a dark figure jumps out and slashes at the duo with his battle axe. Zach uses his fire magic and grabs daniel and himself away. Then suddently, three bullets fly through the air piercing daniel in the leg. Daniel falls down to the ground in pain.

"Stay still both of you", said the man.

"WHO ARE YOU?", yelled Zach. 

"Not the best tone to say to someone when your trying to be spared", said the man. 

"I am-", then Daniel punches the man in the face and grabs Zach.

Daniel and Zach run away and yell "HELP!". 

Sam hears Daniel's voice and rushes to him as he saw Daniel Sam said "Hey, i found you!".

As he said that the axe of the man flies through the air piercing Sam and killing him.
Sams lifeless body lays there while the man comes out of the shadow introducing himself as Adam the bounty hunter.

"Now, if you had just listend to me, your friend would'nt have died", said Adam.

Suddenly, Markus punched Adam with an energy magic infused punch, and the battle beginns. Adam looks at the whole group that had just arrived and lunges at them. Markus and Aaron rush at him and both use spirit magic to attack him. Adam effortly blocks the attack and kicks Aaron back with explosion magic. Aaron was sent back and Markus was slammed into the ground with shockwave magic. Zach rushes at Adam and hits him with multiple flame infused attacks.

"I told you I had a bad feeling about this", said Aaron.

Then Adam rushes at the group again and swings his axe at Zach that was infused with explosion and shockwave magic. Zach doges it but then falls to the ground. Then Adam slamms his axe down at Zach and hits him in the leg. Suddently, Adam was impaled from Daniel's gauntlets. Adam falls down dead and Sam was avenged. Aaron walks to the podium where the book is hidden and takes it.
